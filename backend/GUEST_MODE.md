## Architecture

### Backend Components

#### **1. Database Schema** (`/backend/models/userModel.js`)

```javascript
{
  isGuest: { type: Boolean, default: false, index: true },
  guestMetadata: {
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: null },
    originalRole: { type: String, default: null },
    roleSwitchCount: { type: Number, default: 0 },
    upgradedAt: { type: Date, default: null }
  }
}
```

**Purpose**: Track guest status, metadata, and analytics.

#### **2. Controllers** (`/backend/controllers/authController.js`)

##### **guestRegister**
- **Route**: `POST /api/auth/guest-register`
- **Access**: Public (rate-limited)
- **Input**: `{ name?: string, role?: string }`
- **Output**: `{ user, token, credentials: { email, password }, isGuest: true }`
- **Logic**:
  1. Validates role (defaults to 'applicant')
  2. Generates unique email: `guest-{timestamp}-{random}@demo.huntloop.com`
  3. Uses standard password: `Guest2024!`
  4. Creates user with `isVerified: true`, `isGuest: true`
  5. Returns credentials for user to save
  6. Logs creation event for analytics

##### **switchRole**
- **Route**: `POST /api/auth/switch-role`
- **Access**: Private (authenticated guests only)
- **Input**: `{ newRole: string }`
- **Output**: `{ user, token }`
- **Logic**:
  1. Validates user is a guest
  2. Validates new role is different from current
  3. Updates user role and increments switch count
  4. Generates new JWT with updated role
  5. Logs role switch for analytics

##### **upgradeGuest**
- **Route**: `POST /api/auth/upgrade-guest`
- **Access**: Private (authenticated guests only)
- **Input**: `{ email: string, password: string, confirmPassword: string }`
- **Output**: `{ user, token, emailSent: boolean }`
- **Logic**:
  1. Validates user is a guest
  2. Validates email format and uniqueness
  3. Validates password strength
  4. Hashes password with bcrypt
  5. Updates user to non-guest status
  6. Sends verification email
  7. Marks upgrade timestamp
  8. Logs upgrade event for analytics

#### **3. Middleware** (`/backend/middleware/guestMiddleware.js`)

##### **guestRegisterLimiter**
- **Type**: Rate limiter
- **Limit**: 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Response**: 429 Too Many Requests
- **Logging**: Warns on rate limit exceeded

##### **requireGuest**
- **Type**: Authorization middleware
- **Purpose**: Ensures only guest users access certain routes
- **Response**: 403 Forbidden for non-guests

##### **logGuestActivity**
- **Type**: Analytics middleware
- **Purpose**: Logs guest actions asynchronously
- **Non-blocking**: Uses `setImmediate()`

##### **addGuestIndicator**
- **Type**: Response modifier
- **Purpose**: Adds `isGuestMode: true` to responses for guest users

#### **4. Routes** (`/backend/routes/authRoutes.js`)

```javascript
// Guest registration - Public, rate-limited
router.post('/guest-register', guestRegisterLimiter, guestRegisterValidation, guestRegister);

// Role switching - Private, guests only
router.post('/switch-role', protect, requireGuest, switchRoleValidation, switchRole);

// Account upgrade - Private, guests only
router.post('/upgrade-guest', protect, requireGuest, upgradeGuestValidation, upgradeGuest);
```

- Auto-displays credentials after registration

#### **3. RoleSwitcher** (`/frontend/src/components/RoleSwitcher.js`)

## Security Considerations

### 1. **Rate Limiting**
- Guest registration: 10 per 15 minutes per IP
- Prevents automated abuse
- Returns clear error message when exceeded
- Logged for monitoring

### 2. **Auto-Generated Credentials**
- Email: `guest-{timestamp}-{random}@demo.huntloop.com`
  - Timestamp ensures uniqueness
  - 4-byte random hex adds entropy
  - Total uniqueness: ~4.3 billion combinations per millisecond
- Password: `Guest2024!`
  - Meets complexity requirements
  - Publicly known (by design for demo accounts)
  - Changed upon upgrade

### 3. **Middleware Protection**
- `requireGuest` ensures only guests can switch roles or upgrade
- `protect` ensures authentication before guest operations
- CSRF protection applies to all state-changing requests

### 4. **Data Privacy**
- Guest data treated same as regular users in database
- No special retention policy (yet)
- Analytics logging excludes sensitive data
- Winston logger configured for privacy

### 5. **Upgrade Validation**
- Email uniqueness checked before upgrade
- Password strength enforced (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Email verification sent for security

---

## Analytics & Logging

### Events Logged

All guest events are logged with Winston for analytics:

```javascript
// Guest account creation
logger.info('Guest account created', {
  guestId: user._id,
  role: guestRole,
  name: guestName
});

// Role switch
logger.info('Guest role switched', {
  guestId: req.user.id,
  oldRole: req.user.role,
  newRole: newRole,
  switchCount: currentSwitchCount + 1
});

// Account upgrade
logger.info('Guest account upgraded', {
  userId: req.user.id,
  newEmail: email,
  originalRole: req.user.guestMetadata?.originalRole
});

// Rate limit exceeded
logger.warn('Guest registration rate limit exceeded', {
  ip: req.ip,
  userAgent: req.get('user-agent')
});
```

### Metrics to Track

- **Guest Registration Volume**
  - Registrations per day/week/month
  - Peak registration times
  - Geographic distribution (by IP)

- **Role Distribution**
  - Most popular initial role
  - Role switch patterns
  - Average role switches per guest

- **Upgrade Rate**
  - Percentage of guests who upgrade
  - Time to upgrade (creation → upgrade)
  - Most upgraded role

- **Session Duration**
  - Average session length for guests
  - Engagement by role
  - Feature usage by guests

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Guest registration returns 429

**Cause**: Rate limit exceeded (more than 10 registrations in 15 minutes from same IP)

**Solution**:
- Wait 15 minutes
- Use different IP/network
- Check logs for abuse patterns: `grep "Guest registration rate limit" logs/combined.log`

### Issue: Role switch returns 403

**Cause**: User is not a guest account

**Solution**:
- Verify user has `isGuest: true` in database
- Check that `requireGuest` middleware is applied to route
- Verify JWT token is valid and contains guest user

### Issue: Upgrade fails with "Email already registered"

**Cause**: Email is already in use by another account

**Solution**:
- User must choose different email
- Check database for conflicting email: `db.users.findOne({ email: "..." })`
- Verify email is not just uppercase/lowercase variation

### Issue: Guest banner not appearing

**Cause**: User object doesn't have `isGuest` field or it's false

**Solution**:
- Check user object in localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('huntloop_user')`
- Verify API response includes `isGuest: true`
- Check Dashboard component receives user prop
- Verify GuestModeBanner component is imported

## Best Practices

### For Networking Events

1. **Pre-event Setup**
   - Test guest registration flow

### For Development

1. **Local Testing**
   - Use guest accounts for quick testing
   - Test with different roles
   - Verify role switching works
   - Test upgrade path

2. **Code Maintenance**

## FAQ

**Q: Can guest accounts access all features?**
A: Yes, guest accounts have full access to all features based on their selected role. They are functionally identical to regular accounts except for the temporary nature.

**Q: How long do guest accounts last?**
A: Currently, guest accounts persist indefinitely. Future enhancement will add auto-expiration after 30 days of inactivity.

**Q: Can I convert a guest account to a regular account?**
A: Yes, use the "Upgrade Account" button in the guest banner. You'll need to provide an email and password.

**Q: What happens to my data when I upgrade?**
A: All your data is preserved. You simply add email/password authentication to your existing account.

**Q: Can I switch roles multiple times?**
A: Yes, guest users can switch roles as many times as needed to explore different perspectives.

**Q: Is guest data secure?**
A: Yes, guest data is stored with the same security measures as regular accounts. However, since credentials are simple and publicly known, don't use guest accounts for sensitive data.

**Q: Can I delete a guest account?**
A: Currently, accounts must be deleted manually from the database. Future enhancement will add self-service account deletion.
