# Huntloop Database Seeding Scripts

This directory contains scripts to populate the MongoDB database with realistic sample data for development and testing purposes.

## Overview

The seeding scripts create:
- **10 Recruiter Accounts** from companies like Atlassian, Canva, Google, Accenture, Commonwealth Bank, etc.
- **15 Applicant Accounts** with diverse backgrounds
- **10 Real Job Posts** from actual Australian tech companies with working application links
- **10 Interview Question Sets** with technical, behavioral, and culture-fit questions
- **10 Realistic Resumes** for various tech roles (Full Stack, Data Engineer, DevOps, etc.)
- **20 Training Courses** from platforms like Coursera, Udemy, Pluralsight

## Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB Connection**: Ensure you have a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with:
   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **bcryptjs**: If you encounter any errors, install bcryptjs:
   ```bash
   npm install bcryptjs
   ```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Seed Everything (Recommended)

Run all seed scripts in the correct order:

```bash
npm run seed:all
```

This will sequentially run all seeding scripts and provide a comprehensive summary.

### Option 2: Individual Scripts

You can also run individual seed scripts:

```bash
# Seed recruiters first (required for jobs and questions)
npm run seed:recruiters

# Seed applicants (required for resumes)
npm run seed:applicants

# Seed job posts (requires recruiters)
npm run seed:jobs

# Seed interview question sets (requires recruiters)
npm run seed:questions

# Seed resumes (requires applicants)
npm run seed:resumes

# Seed courses (standalone)
npm run seed:courses
```

## Dependencies Between Scripts

The scripts have dependencies and should be run in this order:

```
1. Recruiters ─┬─> 3. Job Posts
               └─> 4. Question Sets

2. Applicants ───> 5. Resumes

6. Courses (standalone)
```

The `seedAll.js` script handles these dependencies automatically.

## Clearing Data

Each seed script clears its respective collection before inserting new data:
- `seedRecruiters.js` removes all existing recruiters
- `seedApplicants.js` removes all existing applicants
- And so on...

**Warning**: Running these scripts will delete existing data in the respective collections.

## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Error
```
Error: Could not connect to MongoDB
```
**Solution**: Check your `.env` file and ensure `MONGO_URI` is set correctly.

### bcrypt/bcryptjs Error
```
Error: Cannot find module 'bcryptjs'
```
**Solution**: Install bcryptjs:
```bash
npm install bcryptjs
```

### No Recruiters Found
If `seedJobPosts.js` or `seedQuestionSets.js` reports "No recruiters found":
**Solution**: Run `npm run seed:recruiters` first.

### No Applicants Found
If `seedResumes.js` reports "No applicants found":
**Solution**: Run `npm run seed:applicants` first.

## Script Details

| Script | Creates | Dependencies | Runtime |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------|
| `seedRecruiters.js` | 10 recruiters | None | ~2s |
| `seedApplicants.js` | 15 applicants | None | ~2s |
| `seedJobPosts.js` | 10 job posts | Recruiters | ~2s |
| `seedQuestionSets.js` | 10 question sets | Recruiters | ~2s |
| `seedResumes.js` | 10 resumes | Applicants | ~2s |
| `seedCourses.js` | 20 courses | None | ~2s |
| `seedAll.js` | Everything | None | ~15s |

## Development Tips

1. **Quick Reset**: Run `npm run seed:all` to reset all data with fresh samples
2. **Partial Reset**: Run individual scripts to reset specific collections
3. **Custom Data**: Modify the data arrays in each script to customize the seed data
4. **Production**: Never run these scripts in production as they clear existing data

## Next Steps

After seeding:
1. Start your backend server: `npm start` or `npm run dev`
2. Login with any of the seeded accounts
3. Explore the features:
   - Recruiters can view and manage job posts
   - Recruiters can access interview question sets
   - Applicants can browse jobs and courses
   - Applicants can manage their resumes

## Support

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the seed scripts, please check:
1. MongoDB connection is working
2. All dependencies are installed
3. Scripts are run in the correct order (or use `npm run seed:all`)
